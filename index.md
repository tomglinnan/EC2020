Welcome to this GitHub page for EC2020 Elements of Econometrics! This is where I'll post the notes that I make in the live sessions and any extra material that might help you get your head around the course content

## Live Session Material
* **Live Session 1**  main takeaways: correlation is not causation (and where the difference comes from), the (un-)usefulness of R squared, the fact that OLS gives us what we'd hope it would in simple cases, why we need to make assumptions for OLS to work well (be unbiased / efficient). Lots of content but it will all make sense eventually even if not now. **Class 1 notes:** [here](EC2020 Live Session 1.pdf). **Class 3 notes:** [here](Class 3 session 1.pdf)
* **Live Session 2:**  main takeaways: why we control for confounders and how multivariate regression lets us do this, intuition for why beta hat has a variance and what factors make it big or small, and how to interpret OLS coefficients. **Class 1 notes:** [here](Ec2020 Session 2.pdf). **Class 3 notes:** [here](Session 2 class 3.pdf)
* **Live Session 3:**  main takeaways: what testing is, and what we do about it. Make sure you feel confident with the philosophy of testing as well as the specifics of the T and F tests **Class 1 notes:** [here](Session 3.pdf). **Class 3 notes:** [here](ec2020_s3_class_3.pdf)
* **Live Session 4:**  main takeaways: functional forms and omitted variable bas (OVB), with proofs. **Class 1 notes:** [here](Session 4.pdf). **Class 3 notes:** None, as tablet wasn't working (apologies!)
* **Live Session 5:**  main takeaways: the MLR / Gauss Markov assumptions, proof of consistency of OLS, heteroscedasticity and testing for it (White and BP) and WLS. **Class 1 notes:** [here](Session 5.pdf). 
* **Live Session 6:**  main takeaways: an introduction to IV, both in terms of diagrams, formal conditions, and thinking about when the right conditions will occur. **Class 1 notes:** [here](Class 1 - session 6.pdf)
* **Live Session 7:**  on simultaneous equations and measurement error. **Class 1 notes:** [here](Session 7 class 1.pdf)
* **Live Session 8:** on MLE and probit / logit. Make sure you feel ok with MLE in the abstract, then realise that probit and logit models are specific examples of applications of MLE that we use in economics. Have a look at the story motivating probit / logit - I think it's helpful to understand where everything comes from. **Class 1 notes:** [here](ec2020_s_8_class_1.pdf)
* **Live Session 9:** on time series, and why everything comes down to the difference between E(e|X)=0 and E(Xe)=0!  **Class 1 notes:** [here](class_1_session_9.pdf)


## Bonus Resources
These were written by me for previous (and slightly different) courses I've taught at LSE, so they don't match up exactly with the content of EC2020. However you might find them useful to give you another perspective on some of the things we're doing here

1. [Point of Stats](Point of Stats.pdf) - this is a presentation which talks about hypothesis testing, how it's applied to OLS, and what estimation _is_. It might be helpful if you want to see how many of the tools we talk about in EC2020 fit together

2. [Testing](q4q.pdf) - this is a short pdf walking through what hypothesis testing is, intended for those who've never studied statistics before. It might be helpful if you're stuck on this specific topic, as people often are

3. [OVB notes](Some OVB notes.pdf) - on the analogy between OVB and the chain rule!

4. [Interaction Effect Notes](Interaction Effects.pdf) - some proper notes on interaction effects, and how and when to use them
