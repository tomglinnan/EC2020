Welcome to this GitHub page for EC2020 Elements of Econometrics! This is where I'll post the notes that I make in the life sessions and any extra material that might help you get your head around the course content

## Life Session Material

## Bonus Resources
These were written by me for previous (and slightly different) courses I've taught at LSE, so they don't match up exactly with the content of EC2020. However you might find them useful to give you another perspective on some of the things we're doing here

2. [Testing](q4q.pdf) - this is a short pdf walking through what hypothesis testing is, intended for those who've never studied statistics before. It might be helpful if you're stuck on this specific topic, as people often are
